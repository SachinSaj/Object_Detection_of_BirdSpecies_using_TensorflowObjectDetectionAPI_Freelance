# Object Detection of Bird Species using Tensorflow Object Detection API Freelance Work

### * This work was given by a client, who is doing Master's program in Liverpool John Moores University as a part of  project *

The dataset was given by client (Birds.zip).

From the dataset three bird classes was choosed and done tagging using LabelImg about 500 images per classes all in VOC format.

This was pre-proprocessed (Xml to csv and csv to tf records for model training)

For training the model Tensorflow 1 Object Detection API was used.

Created Labelmap.pbtxt and configured config file.

The pre-trained model used was Faster RCNN Inception V2
